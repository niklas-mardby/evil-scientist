## Description of assignment

Create a web page with three sections: 

* a form to add a new evil scientist
* a list of all evil scientists
* a detail view of one evil scientist

### The form
The form should have input fields for name, age, number of henchmen and a short description. Also a button. The user is expected to fill in the form and click the button to add a new evil scientist. The name is added to the middle sections list of names. The rest of the data is stored in an array.

### The list
All added evil scientist should be listed here by name. If you click on a name that scientist is shown in the detail view to the right.

### The detail view
This section shows the one evil scientist that was last clicked on in the list. All details on the evil scientist should be shown (same values as added in the form).

## Suggestions on how to solve assignment
* Create a type alias for an evil scientist object
* Create an array of evil scientist objects
* You need an eventlistener on the Add button
* The event listeners callback should 
    * read all data from form input fields and then empty the input fields
    * add all data to array
    * add a new div for the name
    * add an event listener to div with name
    * name div eventlistener should show all details from array to detail view

## Improvements to assignment
Once you are finished with the assignment described above you can add further functionality like:
* Reset-button that empties the list of evil scientist names
